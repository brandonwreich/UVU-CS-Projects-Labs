Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):

This was a fun project to implement. I think that it was a good project to start out with to get a
good handle on HTML and CSS. It was easy enough that it didn't take a lot of time to work on, but
also it was hard enough that some effort had to be put into it.

One thing I had trouble with was formatting the table. It wasn't too hard in end to achieve the
format that I wanted, but it definetly took me some time and research. Other than that I felt
like the rest came pretty easily and was easy to implement.

                    I am an avid camper. I will go anywhere, anytime to camp, even in the winter. Everything I do is
                    either camping
                    related, or so that I can go camping in the future. Last year I created an LLC called
                    <a id=maukaProject href="https://www.instagram.com/themaukaproject/">The Mauka Project</a> in order
                    to pay for these expeditions.
                    The Mauka Project is an outdoor expedition company that will plan your outdoor trips as well as
                    provide
                    equipment, guides, and all the fun nature can provide. It definitely helps me pay those camping
                    bills and helps
                    me to go on more trips at other peoples expense. There are so many things you can do on these
                    expeditions. You
                    can go rock climbing, white water rafting, canyoneering, or even have a nice relaxing weekend in the
                    woods. I
                    highly recommend that anyone who is able to should spend as much time as possible in nature.

                    Another interest I have is music. Music has always been a part of my life. Growing up each sibling
                    and I were
                    required to take piano lessons. Since then I have learned to play several instruments and have even
                    composed a
                    a few pieces of music myself. Unfortunately I don't have as much time to play or learn new
                    instruments, I enjoy
                    listening to music almost 24/7. I will have to say that my favorite genre of music is definitely
                    classical which
                    is controversial to some other peoples views.

                    What's a computer science major without his geek side. Another interest I have is Star Wars.
                    Anything and everything
                    Star Wars is absolutely amazing and inspired. I constantly watch the movies and tv shows or play the
                    games. Star Wars
                    is one thing that I will never get sick of.
