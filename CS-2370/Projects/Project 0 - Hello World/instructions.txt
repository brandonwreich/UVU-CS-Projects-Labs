Demonstrate that you can build and execute a simple C++ program.

Scoring:

5 points if you use an online compiler such as replit.com, cpp.sh, or onlinegdb.com

10 points if you install a compiler, such as Visual Studio, clang, or g++. (Note that VSCode is NOT a compiler, it is an editor.)

Turn in options:

1. Submit a screen shot of your compile and execution.

2. Demonstrate it in class the next day of class.
