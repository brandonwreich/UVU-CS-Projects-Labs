On a piano, a key has a frequency, say f0. Each higher key (black or white) has a frequency of f0 * rn, where n is the distance (number of keys) from that key, and r is 2(1/12). Given an initial key frequency, output that frequency and the next 3 higher key frequencies.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point using the following statement once before all other cout statements:
cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
Include the units ("Hz") and a newline after each frequency, including the last.

Ex: If the input is:

440.0
(which is the A key near the middle of a piano keyboard), the output is:

440.00 Hz
466.16 Hz
493.88 Hz
523.25 Hz
Note: To compute the next 3 higher key frequencies, use one statement to compute r = 2(1/12) using the pow function (remember to include the cmath library). Then use that r in subsequent statements that use the formula fn = f0 * rn with n being 1, 2, and finally 3.
