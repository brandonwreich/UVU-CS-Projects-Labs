Lab: Vector Template
CS 2370

Background
In Project 4 you built your own vector of ints. In this lab you will make your vector generic by using a
class template.

Requirements
Make a copy of your Vector class from Project 4 and change all references to the type of element
contained in your array to be the template parameter T.
Once again, you are provided a test driver, testVector.cpp, and the test framework in test.h, to
rigorously test your project before you turn it in. The expected output is:
    Test Report:
    Number of Passes = 84
    Number of Failures = 0
You can remove the trace print from the grow function for this lab. Once again, your grade will be the
percentage of tests that you pass.

Implementation Notes
Remember that templates must all be defined inline within a single .h file.
