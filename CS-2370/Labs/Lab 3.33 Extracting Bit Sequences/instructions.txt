Write code that receives 3 inputs:

an integer to process
the starting (rightmost) bit position of the desired sequence (Note: bits are numbered starting at 0 for the least significant bit)
the ending (leftmost) bit position of the desired sequence
Then compute the extracted bits as a stand-alone integer. (Review section 3.11).

The code template provided does the input for you.

Here is a sample test run:

Enter the integer that holds the bits: 60000
Enter the rightmost bit position: 3
Enter the leftmost bit position: 11
Extracting bits 3 through 11 from 60000 = 00000000000000001110101001100000:
332 = 00000000000000000000000101001100
