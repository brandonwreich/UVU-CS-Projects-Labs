Define a function named GetWordFrequency that takes a vector of strings and a search word as parameters. Function GetWordFrequency() then returns the number of occurrences of the search word in the vector parameter (case insensitive).

Then, write a main program that reads a list of words into a vector, calls function GetWordFrequency() repeatedly, and outputs the words in the vector with their frequencies. The input begins with an integer indicating the number of words that follow.

Ex: If the input is:

5 hey Hi Mark hi mark
the output is:

hey 1
Hi 2
Mark 2
hi 2
mark 2
Hint: Use tolower() to set the first letter of each word to lowercase before comparing.

The program must define and use the following function:
int GetWordFrequency(vector<string> wordsList, string currWord)
